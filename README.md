## Features
- **Unibody or Split:** Unique magnetic 4-pin connector allows the keyboard to be used as a single unibody or split into two halves via a USB-C cable. Use unibody mode on the go, and split mode at your desk!
- **Wireless:** Fully wireless operation for portability.
- **Single Microcontroller:** Uses one microcontroller and an MCP23017 GPIO expander, eliminating the need for two controllers or batteries to reduce costs and avoid managing uneven battery discharge.
- **Thumb Trackpoint:** Integrated for precise cursor control.

## Ideal Use
Perfect for users who want a compact, travel-friendly keyboard that adapts to both mobile and desktop setups.
